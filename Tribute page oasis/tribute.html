            <p>
                Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, graduated in Science from
                St. Joseph's College, Trichy in 1954 and specialized in Aeronautical Engineering from Madras Institute of
                Technology (MIT) in 1957. Dr. Kalam is a pioneer in fibre glass technology and led a young team to initiate
                this effort in
                <strong>ISRO</strong> from design, development leading to production of composites rocket motor cases. Dr. Kalam
                made significant contribution as Project Director to develop India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle
                (SLV-3) which successfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in July 1980 and made India
                an exclusive member of Space Club.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was responsible for the evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle programme, particularly the PSLV configuration. After working
                for two decades in ISRO and mastering launch vehicle technologies, Dr. Kalam took up the responsibility of
                developing Indigenous Guided Missiles at Defence Research and Development Organisation as the Chief Executive
                of Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). He was responsible for the development and operationalisationof
                AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles and for building indigenous capability in critical technologies through networking
                of multiple institutions. One of his significant contribution was creating Research Centre Imarat for advanced
                technologies. He was the Scientific Adviser to Defence Minister and Secretary, Department of Defence Research
                & Development from July 1992 to December 1999. During this period he led to the weaponisation of strategic
                missile systems and the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in collaboration with Department of Atomic Energy, which
                made India a nuclear weapon State. He also gave thrust to self-reliance in defence systems by progressing
                multiple development tasks and mission projects such as Light Combat Aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Chairman of Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC) and as an eminent scientist, he led the
                country with the help of 500 experts to arrive at Technology Vision 2020 giving a road map for transforming
                India from the present developing status to a developed nation. Dr. Kalam has served as the Principal Scientific
                Advisor to the Government of India, in the rank of Cabinet Minister, from November 1999 to November 2001
                and was responsible for evolving policies, strategies and missions for many development applications. Dr.
                Kalam was also the Chairman, Ex-officio, of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet (SAC-C) and
                piloted India Millennium Mission 2020.
            </p>
            <p>In the bio-medical area, Dr. Kalam along with his team collaborated with medical specialists in the development
                of Kalam-Raju stent during 1994 - 1996. Kalam-Raju cardiac stent after qualification trials has been fitted
                to many needy patients. This development has further led to the creation of a production unit of state-of-the-art
                stents. Also, he had initiated the use of carbon-carbon and carbon-polymer materials for production of floor
                reaction orthosis calipers which has reduced the weight of the caliper to 1/10th of the original weight during
                1995 & 1996. Over 50,000 children have been fitted with these calipers.
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Kalam took up academic pursuit as Professor, Technology & Societal Transformation at Anna University, Chennai
                from November 2001 and was involved in teaching and research tasks. Above all he took up a mission to ignite
                the young minds for national development by meeting school students across the country. During the last decade,
                Dr. Kalam has addressed over five million youth below the age of 17 and inspired them to become an active
                participant of India Vision 2020. He has addressed several children science congresses across the country.
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Kalam is passionate about bringing rural prosperity through PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas),
                in which science and technology has to play a key role. Based on his diverse experience he has been propagating
                the concept of World Knowledge Platform through which the core competencies of organizations and nations
                can be synergized to innovate and create solutions and products for the challenges of 21st century. </p>
